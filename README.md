# OOPPROJECT

Hi! This my first ever java/OOP project i have done. It is from one of my courses in college. We had to build an app around an certain menu they gave us, i'm not allowed to 
publish that menu. For me that was a really cool challenge, for my first contact with oop and with java. 
APP: I had to build an app that was like a excel page with cells and different spreadsheets. Was propuse to create two different functions, one type would use a sigle cell its
content and the other type with a range of cells. I still had to build a cut buffer that would provide the follwed functions: copy, cut, paste and clear. I would use this fuctions
in cells or in ranges. The ranges were all in the same row or in the same column.
Feel free to explore this code and use it as you will. Hope i can help you same how,
