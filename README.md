-C-
Data Structure is hard. My first interaction with C was not the best, i took my time to learn nodes and algoritms but didnÂ´t manage to know enough. This project was a disapointment for me i knew i could do better if i had try harder. But life is like that you have to fail to learn and that's exacly what i will do. I promisse my next project will be much better. 
APP: In this project i had to do an app to have a certain information about a bus company. Know all the bus, paths, were they stop, etc. It was allowed to remove, add new paths, bus. 
Feel free to explore this code and use it as you will. Hope i can help you same how.

-Java-
Hi! This my first ever java/OOP project i have done. We had to build an app around a certain menu they gave us, i'm not allowed to 
publish that menu. For me that was a really cool challenge, for my first contact with oop and with java. 
APP: I had to build an app that was like a excel page with cells and different spreadsheets. Was propuse to create two different functions, one type would use a sigle cell its
content and the other type with a range of cells. I still had to build a cut buffer that would provide the follwed functions: copy, cut, paste and clear. I would use this fuctions
in cells or in ranges. The ranges were all in the same row or in the same column.
Feel free to explore this code and use it as you will. Hope i can help you same how.
